# Full Stack Turn-Based Campaign System

A full-stack turn-based combat game with comprehensive admin dashboard for content management. Manage campaigns, creatures, and combat mechanics through an intuitive admin interface, then play strategic turn-based battles in an engaging frontend game experience.

## Overview

This is a three-tier application designed for managing and playing turn-based combat scenarios. The system separates content creation (Admin), game logic (Backend), and player experience (Frontend) into distinct, well-architected applications. The backend handles all combat simulations, the admin panel manages game content, and the frontend delivers an engaging mobile-first gaming experience.

## Game Architecture

### Combat Engine

**Action Resolution Flow**:
1. Player selects action → Frontend validates AP availability
2. Request sent to backend with action ID
3. Backend validates action against creature stats
4. Damage calculated: `Raw Damage = Attack × ActionMultiplier`
5. Defense applied: `Final Damage = Raw Damage - (Defense × MitigationRatio)`
6. Accuracy roll: Probability-based hit/miss determination
7. Enemy AI selects counter-action:
   - Scores available actions based on state
   - Low HP (<30%) triggers defensive behavior (1.5× defense boost)
   - Considers AP availability
   - Applies strategic randomness
8. Both actions resolved and damage applied
9. Updated state returned to frontend
10. Combat continues or ends based on HP thresholds

**AI Decision Making**:
- Evaluates available actions based on current combat state
- Prioritizes high-impact actions when healthy
- Switches to defensive posture at low HP
- Respects action point limitations
- Filters out actions with insufficient points
- Applies minimum threshold to avoid poor decisions

**Key Stats**:
- **Max HP**: Total health points
- **Attack**: Base damage output
- **Defence**: Damage reduction capability
- **Action Points**: Resource for performing abilities (regenerates per turn)
- **Speed**: Determines turn order (higher = acts first)

### Data Models

**Creature**:
```
{
  id: UUID,
  name: string,
  description: string,
  isPlayable: boolean,
  imageUrl: string,
  stats: {
    maxHp: number,
    attack: number,
    defence: number,
    actionPoint: number,
    speed: number
  }
}
```

**Action**:
```
{
  id: UUID,
  name: string,
  description: string,
  accuracy: number (0-1),
  multiplier: number (damage multiplier),
  type: string,
  tag: string,
  actionWeight: number
}
```

**Campaign**:
```
{
  id: UUID,
  name: string,
  description: string,
  status: "active" | "inactive",
  imageUrl: string,
  outroText: string,
  outroImage: string,
  stages: [
    {
      index: number,
      enemyCreatureId: UUID
    }
  ]
}
```

**Campaign Session**:
```
{
  id: UUID,
  userId: UUID,
  campaignTemplateId: UUID,
  currentStageIndex: number,
  playerCreatureId: UUID,
  currentHp: number,
  maxHp: number,
  currentActionPoint: number,
  maxActionPoint: number,
  status: "ongoing" | "completed" | "failed",
  createdAt: timestamp,
  updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

---

## Development Workflow

### Running All Services Locally

**Terminal 1 - Backend**:
```bash
cd backend
go run main.go
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend**:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 3 - Admin**:
```bash
cd admin
npm run dev
```

Then open:
- Game: `http://localhost:5173`
- Admin: `http://localhost:5174`
- Backend: `http://localhost:8080`

### Database Management

**Run migrations**:
```bash
cd backend
# Migrations run automatically on startup with AUTO_MIGRATE=true
# Manual migration with golang-migrate CLI:
migrate -path migrations -database "$DATABASE_URL" up
```

**Reset database**:
```bash
psql -d game_db -c "DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE; CREATE SCHEMA public;"
# Then restart backend to re-run migrations
```

### Image Upload Configuration

The system uses **Cloudinary** for image management. To configure:

1. Create a Cloudinary account at https://cloudinary.com
2. Get your Cloud Name, API Key, and API Secret
3. Add to backend `.env`:
   ```
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
   ```
4. Images are organized by folder:
   - Creatures: `creatures/{uuid}`
   - Campaign intro: `campaigns/{uuid}/intro`
   - Campaign outro: `campaigns/{uuid}/outro`

## Game Mechanics

### Combat System

**Turn Structure:**
- Player and enemy alternate selecting actions
- Each action costs Action Points (AP)
- Combat continues until one participant's HP reaches 0

**Action Resolution:**
- Actions have accuracy ratings (0-100%) that affect hit chance
- Successful hits apply damage multipliers from action definition
- Damage calculations include creature base stats
- Enemy AI selects optimal actions based on game state

**Action Points (AP):**
- Each creature starts each turn with a pool of AP
- Actions consume AP based on their weight
- Remaining AP rolls to next turn if unused
- Maximum AP threshold prevents hoarding

**Campaign Progression:**
- Campaigns consist of multiple stages with increasing difficulty
- Each stage presents a different enemy creature
- Player creature persists health/AP across stages
- Campaign completion unlocks rewards

## Game Flow

```
Home → Select Campaign → Choose Player Creature → Battle → Next Stage → Victory Screen
```

1. **Campaign Selection**: Browse available campaigns and their descriptions
2. **Creature Selection**: Pick your character from available playable creatures
3. **Combat**: Execute actions in turn-based combat against enemy
4. **Progression**: Advance to next stage or complete campaign
5. **Results**: View campaign summary and statistics

## Database Schema

The application uses PostgreSQL with the following main entities:

- **users**: Player accounts
- **creatures**: Creature definitions (playable and enemy types)
- **actions**: Combat actions with mechanics
- **campaign_templates**: Campaign configurations
- **campaign_stages**: Stage definitions within campaigns
- **campaign_sessions**: Active player campaign progress
- **fights**: Individual combat encounters
- **creature_actions**: Actions available to creatures

Migrations are automatically applied on startup with `AUTO_MIGRATE=true`.

## Architecture

### Clean Layered Design

**Frontend:**
- Pages: Route-specific components
- Components: Reusable UI elements
- Services: API communication layer
- Context: Global state management
- Types: TypeScript interfaces and types

**Backend:**
- Handlers: HTTP request/response handling
- Services: Business logic and game rules
- Repository: Database queries and transactions
- Domain: Core business entities and rules

This separation enables:
- Easy testing through dependency injection
- Clear responsibility boundaries
- Simple swapping of implementations
- Reusable service logic
